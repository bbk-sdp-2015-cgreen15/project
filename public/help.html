    <h1>“What If Analyser” User Manual</h1>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Purpose</h2><br>
    <p>The purpose of this software :<br>
    To be able to predict investment vehicle performance over time.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>What does it do?</h3>
    <p>Assuming a client has certain financial products e.g. Pension(s) ISA(s) Mortgage(s) Loan(s);<br>
    We want to be able to look at the balances and values for each of the products at any given point in time.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>How is this achieved?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Each product can be represented by a “widget”.<br>
    Widgets can be moved around on the screen so you can have more than one at a time (see screenshot )</p>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>Widget workflow –</h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>To create a widget press the “Add Widget” button</li>
        <li>You can name your widget (*1) (widgets are numbered from 0 onwards )</li>
        <li>The new widget pops onto the screen and you can <a href="#move">move</a> it somewhere else by enabling dragging (see 1)</li>
        <li>You firstly choose the type of product – Pension / ISA / Mortgage / Loan</li>
        <li>Once you click one you can enter basic information such as product duration / interest rate / monthly payment etc</li>
        <li>Once these are entered click save and the system will calculate a schedule or payments and a graph of value</li>
        <li>The schedule of payments ( and balances ) can be seen by clicking the ( table ) icon</li>
        <li>The graph of value can be seen by clicking the ( graph) icon</li>
        <li>The schedule of payments can be altered to for instance step up payments at a certain stage or add one extra lump sum payment ( or value extraction – see notes 4 and 5)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can have more than one widget on the screen and they can be of different types with different start and end dates etc</p>
    <br>
    <p>The net worth graph ( 6) shows the total balance of all the different widgets</p>
    <br>
    <p>GRAPHS – TO get to the value graph click the graph icon.  Note that there is a navigation bar at the bottom of the graph that allows you to zoom in / out on which part of the time series you want to view on the main graph.  By default this may not show the full time.</p>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <br>
    <h4><a id="move"></a>Moving a widget</h4>
    <br>
    <p>Mouse over the widget header bar and you will see the cursor changes to a cross shape.  You can now drag the widget around.</p>
    <br>
<pre>

    Widget naming not implemented yet.  At the moment they are numbered 0,1,2 etc

    Lump sum payment / value extraction.  The schedule of payments is set out much like an
    excel spreadsheet might be.  You can add an extra payment by putting the amount in the box.

    Copy Down.  It is possible if desired to up ( or down ) payments from a certain date forward by doing the following .
    Put the new payment in the appropriate date box.  Click the “copy down” arrow ( see icon )
    HOWEVER – once this is done it will overwrite any existing stepped or other payments below it.
    ALSO NOTE – if you then go back to the stage 1 e.g. basic info and enter new interest rate etc.
    It will overwrite any copydown information you have entered here.  If you screw things up you can
    easily delete the widget and start again!

    6) Net Worth Graph.
    If you have more than one widget this will add up all the various balances and show the total value
    of all investments over the total time of the various widgets.

</pre>

    <h3>Assumptions</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Compound interest is calculated and added (or subtracted) daily.</p>
    <p>At the moment there is no provision for taking off broker fees.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Future Features</h3>
    <br>
    <p>At the moment you can’t save a set of widgets or assign them to a user profile ( stuff for future )</p>
    <br>
