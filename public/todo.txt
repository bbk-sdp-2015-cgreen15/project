add inputs as spikes to the chart



set chart to full range y default

once a monthly timeseries has been generated - then grey out the input values !!

put months in utils or constants file



Save - should update series for chart


Separation of concerns !!

Model the classes

Make Date Readonly
make long timeseries

Fix date change bug on chart

Monthly - copy down
months from start to finish
- get javascript days in month
- separate module to make the dates


use nodeJs to generate timeseries based on start and end dates

refactor routes into separate modules !

constants for stages
only drag thing when on header bar then remove draggable toggler

PERSON DETAILS INPUT !!

use keith wood's datepick - sort this out

put sub templates in separate files
